//////////
///Having searched the internet far and wide for an animal taming mastery script, and having found none suitable, I decided to make my own.
///Make sure your taming is at least 90 and you have correctly applied the "Combat Training" mastery first, by single clicking the book for
///its context menu, and selecting the appropriate Mastery. 
///Simply opening the book and selecting the mastery will give you an error message, it must be done through the book's single-click context menu.
///This script will activate the Animal Taming Combat Training Mastery repeatedly until your mana falls below 30, at which point it will attempt
///to meditate until either your meditation attempt is successful, or your mana is above 143. Either way, whether through meditation or normal
///mana regen, once your mana has reached 143, it will again spam the Animal Taming Combat Training Mastery until your mana falls below 30.
///The minimum mana can be adjusted, so can the maximum: you will almost definitely need to adjust the maximum, as I set mine to 143 since my 
///maximum mana was 145. YMMV.
///I truly hope you enjoy this script!
